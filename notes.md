**Visualizing Data:**

1. _Acquire:_ Obtain the data, whether from a file on a disk or a source over a network.

2. _Parse:_ Provide some structure for the data's meaning, and order it into categories.
  The amount of Data one can collect and analyze is immense. It is necessary to put the data you collect it into a structure.
  This structure will make it easier to know convey to others what data you have by format, tags, names, and indices.

3. _Filter:_ Remove all but the data of interest.
  After putting the data into a structure. You will have to filter out the data that is not necessary for your Data Visualization. If you are doing a specific gender visualization, you would have to remove the genders you did not want in your data set.

4. _Mine:_ Apply methods from statistics or data mining as a way to discern patterns or place the data in mathematical context.

5. _Represent:_ Choose a basic visual model, such as a bar graph, list, or tree.

6. _Refine:_ Improve the basic representation to make it clearer and more visually engaging.

7. _Interact:_ Add methods for manipulating the data or controlling what features are visible.

When defining the circle SVG shape, three necessary attributes are attached:
cx - The x-axis coordinate of the center of the circle.
cy - The y-axis coordinate of the center of the circle.
r - The radius of the circle.

SVG Coordinate Space works in the same way that mathematical graph coordinate space works except for two important features:
1 - SVG Coordinate space has x=0 and y=0 coordinates fall on the top left.
2 - SVG Coordinate space has the Y coordinate growing from top to bottom.
Which means as Y increases, the coordinates move down, not up.
